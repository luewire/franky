                The material on this site is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or used
                as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete or more
                timely sources of information. Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own risk.
                This site may contain certain historical information. Historical information, necessarily, is not

                Shipping and delivery dates for any and all so-called “limited edition” and/or “pre-order” sales of
                product(s) are not guaranteed unless otherwise specified.
                Products on this Webstore are limited to the sizes, colors and variants listed on this Webstore. If a
                size or variant does not appear on this Webstore, it is currently unavailable.
                If Blonded decides to offer any additional products in this Webstore, such future products will also be
                covered by these Terms.
                Certain products or services may be available exclusively online through the website. These products or
                services are sold on a final sale basis, may have limited quantities, and are not subject to return or
                exchange. 
                We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our products
                that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color will be
                accurate.
                We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Services to any
                person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We
                reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of
                products or product pricing are subject to change at anytime without notice, at the sole discretion of
                us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or service
                made on this site is void where prohibited.
                We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased
                or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected.
                SECTON 6 - DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS
                If you receive defective products, please notify us immediately and within a reasonable time after you
                have detected that the products are defective. If Blonded reasonably determines that the products are in
                fact defective, Blonded reserves the right to send you a non-defective identical replacement item.
                SECTION 7 - ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION 
                We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us for any reason without explanation. We may,
                in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
                These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit
                card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a
                change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing
                address/phone number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit
                orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.
                You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases
                made at our webstore. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your
                email address and credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions
                and contact you as needed.
                SECTON 8 - RESALE POLICY
                You may purchase products from us for personal use only and not for resale. By placing an order on our
                website or affiliated websites, you certify that you are purchasing products for your own personal use
                and not for resale.
                SECTION 9 - OPTIONAL TOOLS
                We may provide you with access to third-party tools over which we neither monitor nor have any control
                nor input. 
                You acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such tools ”as is” and “as available” without any
                warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement. We shall have no
                liability whatsoever arising from or relating to your use of optional third-party tools.
                Any use by you of optional tools offered through the site is entirely at your own risk and discretion
                and you should ensure that you are familiar with and approve of the terms on which tools are provided by
                the relevant third-party provider(s).
                We may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the website (including, the
                release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall also be subject to these
                Terms of Service.
                SECTION 10 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS
                Certain content, products and services available via our Service may include materials from
                third-parties.
                Third-party links on this site may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated with us.
                We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and we do not warrant and
                will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any
                other materials, products, or services of third-parties.
                We are not liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of goods, services, resources,
                content, or any other transactions made in connection with any third-party websites. Please review
                carefully the third-party's policies and practices and make sure you understand them before you engage
                in any transaction. Complaints, claims, concerns, or questions regarding third-party products should be
                directed to the third-party.
                SECTON 11 - PAYMENTS
                Blonded may accept some or all of a variety of payment options, including but not limited to Visa,
                MasterCard, American Express, Discover, PayPal, Apple Pay, and other digital payment services. Prices
                appear on this Webstore and exclude sales tax unless otherwise stated. Blonded may change the prices for
                products at any time by posting new prices on this Webstore.
                By paying using your credit or debit card, or any other payment method, you confirm that the card is
                yours and that there are sufficient funds or credit available to cover the charges.
                Prices may exclude delivery charges, which may be added to the total amount and will be calculated and
                displayed on screen prior to you submitting your payment details. Typically, the purchase will appear on
                your credit card or bank statement as Blonded. If you have any questions about what to expect on your
                credit card statement, please contact customercare@blonded.co.
                It is always possible that, despite Blonded’s best efforts, some of the items listed on this Webstore
                may be incorrectly priced. Blonded will usually verify prices as part of Blonded’s dispatch procedure so
                that, where a product’s correct price is less than Blonded’s stated price, Blonded will charge the lower
                amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product’s correct price is higher than the price stated
                on this Webstore, Blonded will usually, at Blonded’s discretion, either contact you for instructions
                before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. Blonded is under
                no obligation to provide the product to you at an incorrect (e.g., lower) price, even after Blonded has
                sent you a Dispatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and/or could have reasonably been
                recognized by you.
                Billing to your credit or debit card will take place prior to or at the time of dispatch in respect of
                physical product(s), or in respect of digital content, at the time of your purchase or soon afterwards.
                Blonded may use a third party service provider to process payments, but will ensure that any payment
                processor engaged by Blonded will use security to encrypt credit or debit card data.
                Blonded will check all transactions for signs of fraud and may use a third party service provider to do
                so. If your order is flagged for fraud, your order will be delayed, and eventually a representative will
                contact you to verify your information. Please contact customercare@blonded.co with any questions
                related to your order if you are notified it is flagged for fraud.
                SECTION 12 - PERSONAL INFORMATION
                Your submission of personal information through the store is governed by our Privacy Policy. Click here
                to view our Privacy Policy.
                SECTION 13 - ERRORS, INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS
                Occasionally there may be information on our site or in the Service that contains typographical errors,
                inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, product
                shipping charges, transit times and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
                inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information in
                the Service or on any related website is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after
                you have submitted your order).
                We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Service or on any related
                website, including without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified
                update or refresh date applied in the Service or on any related website, should be taken to indicate
                that all information in the Service or on any related website has been modified or updated.
                SECTION 14 - PROHIBITED USES
                In addition to other prohibitions as set forth in the Terms of Service, you agree that you shall not use

                You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the
                service at any time, without notice to you.
                You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service
                and all products and services delivered to you through the service are (except as expressly stated by
                us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or
                conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of
                merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and
                non-infringement.
                In no case shall Blonded, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns,
                suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct,
                indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without
                limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar
                damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising
                from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim

                the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions,
                our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                SECTION 20 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT
                The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not
